# Hen Heang — Developer Portfolio

Backend-focused portfolio for [Hen Heang](https://henheang.site), a Java and Spring Boot developer based in Seoul. The site presents professional experience, engineering case studies, an open backend learning lab, recruiter-friendly resume views, and a retrieval-grounded AI assistant.

[Live site](https://henheang.site) · [Resume](https://henheang.site/resume) · [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hen-heang) · [GitHub](https://github.com/Hen-Heang)

## Portfolio focus

- Primary engineering stack: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, MyBatis, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.
- Supporting product stack: Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Supabase, and AI integrations.
- Major projects include architecture, API, data-model, security, and trade-off details on their case-study pages.
- Supabase-managed portfolio content falls back to typed static data when credentials are absent or a query fails.

## Featured work

- **H-Phsar:** Spring Boot and MyBatis B2B marketplace API with Spring Security, JWT, PostgreSQL, order workflows, and real-time notifications.
- **AuthHub:** reusable Spring Security service with token revocation, MFA, RBAC, audit logging, Flyway, and PostgreSQL.
- **Hengo:** Next.js 16 and React 19 application written in TypeScript. Supabase Auth and Postgres use Row Level Security; authenticated Next.js AI routes use the Vercel AI SDK and OpenAI for structured and streamed feedback.
- **Money Flow:** Next.js finance PWA with Supabase RLS, scheduled jobs, AI-assisted insights, push notifications, and a Neon backup.

## Technology

**Portfolio application:** Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Motion, Supabase, Vercel Analytics, and Vercel Speed Insights.

**Professional focus:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, MyBatis, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Redis, eGovFramework, REST APIs, testing, and Docker.

## Project structure

```text
app/                         Next.js App Router pages, metadata, and API routes
data/                        Typed static content and Supabase fallbacks
data/lab/backend/            Validated backend curriculum and articles
e2e/                         Playwright browser tests
public/                      Images and static assets
scripts/                     Repository utilities and seed script
src/components/              Homepage, layout, project, resume, and UI components
src/lib/                     Types, schemas, database access, AI, and utilities
supabase/                    Local Supabase configuration and migrations
```

Backend Lab content is parsed with Zod during module load and build. Published topics create detail routes; planned topics remain discoverable in the roadmap without creating empty pages. Learning progress is stored locally in the visitor’s browser.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hen-Heang/hen-heang-portfolio.git
cd hen-heang-portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`. No environment variables are required to render the public site because typed static fallbacks are included.

- **Supabase:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. The service-role key is required for contact submissions and protected content operations.
- **OpenAI:** `OPENAI_API_KEY` enables the portfolio assistant. `OPENAI_MODEL`, `OPENAI_DEEP_MODEL`, and `OPENAI_FALLBACK_MODEL` optionally override built-in model defaults.
- **Rate limiting:** `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` provide cross-instance limits for AI and contact requests. Local development falls back to an in-memory limiter.
- **Live evaluations:** `RUN_LIVE_EVALS=1` enables billed model evaluations when a valid OpenAI key is present.

Admin-managed JSON is validated with the same Zod schemas used by the public site. Static files in `data/` remain the fallback source when Supabase is unavailable.

## Scripts and verification

```bash
npm run lint          # ESLint
npm run typecheck     # TypeScript
npm run test          # Vitest
npm run test:watch    # Vitest watch mode
npm run build         # Production build
npm run test:e2e      # Playwright; starts or reuses the local Next.js server
npm run format        # Prettier write
npm run format:check  # Prettier check
```

Install Chromium once with `npx playwright install chromium`. Linux and CI environments can use `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`.

## Theme and accessibility

The site supports light and dark themes and defaults to the visitor’s system theme. It includes keyboard-accessible navigation and dialogs, visible focus treatment, reduced-motion support, semantic landmarks, responsive layouts, and print styles for both resume views.

## Deployment

The production site is deployed on Vercel. CI runs lint, type checking, unit tests, build verification, and Playwright checks before deployment.
