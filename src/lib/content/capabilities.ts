/**
 * Canonical public capability model — the single source of truth for the
 * technologies the portfolio presents as primary skills.
 *
 * Why this is curated rather than derived from `portfolio_skills`:
 * the database stores 27 rows covering everything ever used (HTML, CSS,
 * Bootstrap, IDEs, Postman, MySQL, Tailwind, React, …). That is a useful
 * record, but it is not what a recruiter should scan. This model is the
 * short, deliberate public list; the database rows stay untouched and remain
 * available to the admin panel and the assistant's detailed knowledge.
 *
 * Rules encoded here (asserted in capabilities.test.ts):
 * - Four capability groups, max five technologies each.
 * - No proficiency levels, percentages, or Expert/Advanced/Intermediate labels.
 * - AI is presented separately as a statement, not as a skill column, because
 *   it describes how he works rather than a technology he claims depth in.
 * - Supporting technologies (`secondaryTechnologies`) are documented per
 *   project instead of being displayed as primary skills.
