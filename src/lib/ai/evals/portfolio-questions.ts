/**
 * Portfolio assistant evaluation dataset.
 *
 * Two consumers:
 *  - `retrieval-evals.test.ts` (runs in every `pnpm test`, no API calls): for
 *    each case, checks that the retriever pulls in `expectedSectionIds` and
 *    that `requiredFacts` appear in the retrieved context; `forbiddenClaims`
 *    is checked against the *entire* static knowledge base (a claim that
 *    should never be fabricated anywhere, not just absent from one query's
 *    slice).
 *  - `live-model.test.ts` (skipped unless `RUN_LIVE_EVALS=1` and a real
 *    `OPENAI_API_KEY` are set — costs real tokens): sends the question to
 *    the actual model and checks the answer contains `requiredFacts`, avoids
 *    `forbiddenClaims`, and — for the prompt-injection cases — never leaks
 *    system-prompt text.
