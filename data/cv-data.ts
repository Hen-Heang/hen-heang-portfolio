/**
 * CV Data - Single Source of Truth
 * ================================
 * Edit ONLY this file to update your CV. Both /cv (portfolio-style) and
 * /resume (ATS-friendly) render from this same data through `getSiteContent("cv")`.
 *
 * Sections you can update:
 *  - personal    → name, title, contact info, links
 *  - summary     → professional summary paragraph
 *  - experience  → work history (newest first)
 *  - education   → degrees, certifications, training
 *  - skills      → skill categories (text lists, no proficiency bars)
 *  - projects    → featured projects (`featured: true` shows on /resume too)
 *  - languages   → spoken languages (text level, no percentages)
