 * AI-related knowledge, deliberately split into two categories the way a

 * 2. AI-assisted software development — using AI tools to build software.

 * Every item here is verified against this repository or the projects it
 * describes (app/api/chat/route.ts, data/projects.ts, data/cv-data.ts).
 * Deliberately excluded because unverified: model training, fine-tuning,
 * building vector databases, autonomous AI agents, and LangChain — none of
