/**
 * Skill status/evidence taxonomy for the AI portfolio assistant.
 *
 * This is deliberately a *different* model from `data/skills.ts` (the
 * level 1-5 / duration list that powers the CV and resume pages, and the
 * assistant's existing duration-detail knowledge sections). That file
 * answers "how long has he used X"; this one answers "how deep is X, and
 * does the portfolio have evidence for it" — the distinction the assistant
 * needs to never overstate a skill it hasn't shown proof of.
 *
 * Nothing here is invented: every entry is grounded in something that
 * already exists elsewhere in the codebase —
 * - `primary` skills are exactly `capabilityGroups` from
 *   src/lib/content/capabilities.ts (the curated public stack), exploded
 *   from grouped labels ("Docker/GitHub Actions") into individual entries.
 * - `working-knowledge` skills come from `secondaryTechnologies`
 *   (capabilities.ts) or from `data/skills.ts` rows that never made the
 *   curated primary list.
 * - `learning` skills come from content the site already publishes as
 *   not-yet-shipped: the Backend Engineering Lab's `status: "planned"`
 *   roadmap items (data/lab/backend/planned.ts) and the in-progress entry
 *   in data/education.ts.
 *
 * `projectSlugs` is never hand-typed — it's derived from `Project.skills`
 * (data/projects.ts) below, so the two can't drift out of sync.
